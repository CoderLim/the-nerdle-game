                </h2>
                <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  <p>Nerdle is an online math puzzle game where players have to guess a hidden mathematical equation within six attempts. Each equation consists of numbers, mathematical symbols (+, -, √ó, √∑, etc.), and a solution, and the player needs to guess the correct equation.</p>
                  <p>Unlike traditional puzzles, Nerdle blends elements of logic, strategy, and basic arithmetic operations. The game offers multiple levels of difficulty, making it accessible for everyone, from math novices to seasoned mathematicians.</p>
                  <p>Players need to input their guesses into the grid, and the game will provide feedback about the accuracy of their guess. The feedback is color-coded:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
                    <li><strong className="text-green-400">Green:</strong> The number or operator is in the correct position.</li>
                    <li><strong className="text-purple-400">Purple:</strong> The number or operator is in the equation but not in the correct position.</li>
                    <li><strong className="text-gray-400">Black:</strong> The number or operator does not appear in the equation.</li>

                <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  <p>Playing Nerdle is simple, but the challenge increases as you progress. Here's a step-by-step guide to playing:</p>
                  <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 ml-4">
                    <li><strong className="text-blue-400">Make Your First Guess:</strong> The game grid consists of eight slots. You need to input a valid mathematical equation with numbers and operators.</li>
                    <li><strong className="text-blue-400">Get Feedback:</strong> After you submit your guess, the game will provide feedback with color-coded clues.</li>
                    <li><strong className="text-blue-400">Refine Your Guess:</strong> Based on the feedback, you should refine your guesses to narrow down the correct equation.</li>
                    <li><strong className="text-blue-400">Solve the Puzzle:</strong> Keep guessing until you either solve the puzzle or run out of attempts (maximum six guesses).</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Nerdle is not just about guessing the numbers but also involves understanding the relationships between operators and numbers. You'll need to think about which numbers make sense with specific mathematical operations to arrive at the correct equation.</p>

                  Nerdle Strategies: Tips to Improve Your Game
                </h2>
                <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  <p>While Nerdle is easy to pick up, it's not always easy to win. Here are some tips and strategies to help you improve your gameplay and solve the puzzles faster:</p>

                  <div className="grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
                    <div className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-700">
                      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-purple-400 mb-3">1. Start with Simple Equations</h3>
                      <p>In the first few guesses, try starting with simple equations. This helps to establish a baseline and can provide useful feedback. You can start by guessing equations with small numbers and simple operations like addition or subtraction.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-700">
                      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-purple-400 mb-3">2. Focus on Operators</h3>
                      <p>Operators are key in solving Nerdle puzzles. If you get a number wrong, you may still learn something valuable about the operators used in the equation. Pay close attention to whether your guesses fit with the arithmetic structure of the equation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-700">
                      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-purple-400 mb-3">3. Use Elimination</h3>
                      <p>One of the best ways to approach Nerdle is by using the process of elimination. Once you receive feedback, focus on eliminating numbers or operators that don't appear in the solution. This narrows down the possibilities and makes it easier to guess the correct equation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div className="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-700">
                      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-purple-400 mb-3">4. Think About Common Equations</h3>
                      <p>When you start narrowing down the equation, think about common math equations or formulas that might fit. For example, simple multiplication or division equations like "4 √ó 5 = 20" are common in Nerdle puzzles, so consider these possibilities when refining your guesses.</p>
                    </div>
                  </div>

                  <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-900 to-purple-900 p-6 rounded-lg border border-blue-700">
                    <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-blue-400 mb-3">5. Stay Calm and Logical</h3>
                    <p>Nerdle can be tricky, especially if you're on your final guess. The key is to stay calm and approach the puzzle logically. Break down the problem into smaller parts, analyze the feedback carefully, and make an educated guess based on the available clues.</p>
